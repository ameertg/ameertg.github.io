  Hi, welcome! I am a third year PhD candidate at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/nkokciya/">Nadin KÃ¶kciyan</a>.
  My PhD focuses on computational methods to make implicit information explicit in the context of online argumentation. 
  More broadly, I am interested in theories and models of collective reasoning in humans and finding ways that technology can be used to resolve disagreement and encourage better discussion outcomes.
  I created this blog to work on communicating my ideas and work, currently looking for PostDoc positions, so please get in touch to have a chat!
