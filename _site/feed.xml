It seeks to answer a deeply epistomological question: given what I (and others around me) know, what conclusions can I (or we) draw?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the world of classical logic, barring the bickering amongst logicians of which theory is the best, this question has clear cut answers. But, classical logic makes a whole load of assumptions about knowledge, but primarily, most logics require knowledge to be consistent. Any inconsistency, like “I think that I am happy, but I also feel sad” causes the whole world to implode in on itself and truth collapses under its wreckage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say for a fact there are days where I am simultaneously happy and sad, where actions are simulatenously moral and immoral and a hotdog is both a sandwhich and not. The world is full of inconsistencies, yet here you are reading my little blog post (probably because I’m standing behind you nodding my head and asking you what you think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Postmodernists be damned, most of us also recognise that some truths about the world still exist. So if the world is inconsistent, if we all disagree all the time, how do we know what’s true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, (even before the invention of classical logic) somebody made the miraculous discovery that we all have reasons for the beliefs we hold. And we really like to make others agree with us by yelling our reasons at them and covering our ears until they give in to the barrage of noise and say “sure, whatever”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this system is great, especially when its me doing the talking. Sometimes, unfortunately, we have to concede and hear people out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, how do we know who and what to believe? who’s giving better reasons? why should I be convinced that Eppstein didn’t kill himself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what argumentation theorists get paid to argue about. One of the main ways of doing this is by studying the common patterns of argument that we come across when we look at data and identifying the ways in which these arguments could be called into question. This kind of critical questioning has two challenges, in the first case we need to know which set of critical questions apply to the argument at hand and also, which question(s) is(are) the most relevant to challenge what has been said.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ameer Saadat-Yazdi</name><email>ameer.saadat@ed.ac.uk</email></author><category term="thoughts" /><summary type="html">Argumentation is a field of study that fundamentally concerns itself with processes of reasoning.

It was completed under the supervision of &lt;a href=&quot;https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rsarkar/&quot;&gt;Rik Sarkar&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of this project was twofold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifying whether algebraic topology can act as a measure of brain deterioration, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Training more explainable models for Alzheimer’s detection and brain age prediction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/brains.png&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ask yourself what is algebraic topology? and, why do we care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;topology-and-data&quot;&gt;Topology and data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the first question, algebraic topology is a subfield of general topology, a mathematical discipline which studies shapes much like geometry. While geometry studies shapes concretely, in terms of size, distances and angles, topology assumes that all shapes are infinitely stretchy and squishy so that a ball can be squished into a cube and vice versa. The question that topology then tries to answer is how do we know which shapes can be moulded into each other and which ones can’t. Algebraic topology, provides a set of tools in which this can be done by assigning algebraic objects to shapes in order to characterise their structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main tool used in my research was homology, which assigns an algebraic object, called a group, to each shape to describe the way the holes in the shape interact with one another. In essence what this means is that we have a general way to measure and classify the holes of an object in arbitrary dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topology in and of itself is a very abstract area of pure maths that emerged in the early 20th century. Algebraic topology which followed in the proceeding decades adds an additional layer of abstraction by trying to describe shapes with these ‘algebraic objects’. So you may be wondering why any of this is relevant to data analysis and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are given a set of points in 3D space that are randomly sampled from the surface of a donut. Now, if you didn’t know what kind of distribution the points were sampled from, how would you get an idea of what that distribution could look like? One approach would be to perform some kind of regression on the points, but then, could you ensure that the donut hole would remain intact in the regression model?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://eric-bunch.github.io/images/noisy_circle_persistence_simplexes.png&quot; width=&quot;70%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where topological data analysis comes in. The main idea here being that if we were to inflate each point so that all the points are touching, we get something that should look vaguely like a bumpy donut. And then we can use homology to measure if this bumpy donut has the same structure as a donut. If the homologies are different then there is no way in which the bumpy donut can be smoothed to get the original shape back. However, if they are the same, there is a high chance that the points where obtained from something that looks roughly like a donut. So, topology can be used to understand the shape of data in places where traditional data science would fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets us to the motivation for using topology on MRI scans. Every brain is unique, we can’t really expect geometric measures to directly tell us how different a sick brain is from a healthy one because the two are always going to be geometrically very different, in terms of size, shape, density, etc…. Topology can however provide useful information by ignoring the peculiarities of each individual’s brain and instead relying on more structural information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give a quick summary of our results from the paper, we found that topology can be used as a fairly good measure of age. However, topology struggles to identify subtle distinctions between brains with slightly abnormal ageing patterns which can be quite common. Topology on it’s own is also a bad measure of Alzheimer’s because it can’t distinguish between degeneration due to ageing and degeneration due to the disease. In order to counteract this issue we found that by predicting the topology of a healthy brain at the subject’s age and then subtracting this from their true topology we can drastically improve classification results.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea of putting myself in situations where I’m forced to confront my own limitations. In every story, there is a character at ease in her own environment, stagnant and unaware of her own potential. The story begins when that ease is disturbed; a catalyst emerges from some internal dynamics, external forces or a combination of both which pushes against the inertia generated by comfort. And only in the face of this pressure can she sense the contours of her own self, recognise her capabilities and push against them to redefine their shape. It is only against this force that the amorphous blob is shaped and hardened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound, much like the catalysts of stories is a change in pressure around us. It pervades our environment and is constantly shaping our interactions with it. And so, the question I tried to answer in making this piece is how can I shape the sound to press on the boundaries of my &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt;. The goal was to create something so heavy, so oppressive, that it would force me out of the lull of time passing. To force me to confront myself and reckon with the things that I’m afraid of. In this way, at least to me, when you face ugliness and harshness head on, what emerges is always a thing of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
