Argumentation is a field of study that fundamentally concerns itself with processes of reasoning. It seeks to answer a deeply epistomological question: given what I (and others around me) know, what conclusions can I (or we) draw? 

In the world of classical logic, barring the bickering amongst logicians of which theory is the best, this question has clear cut answers. But, classical logic makes a whole load of assumptions about knowledge, but primarily, most logics require knowledge to be consistent. Any inconsistency, like "I think that I am happy, but I also feel sad" causes the whole world to implode in on itself and truth collapses under its wreckage.

I can say for a fact there are days where I am simultaneously happy and sad, where actions are simulatenously moral and immoral and a hotdog is both a sandwhich and not. The world is full of inconsistencies, yet here you are reading my little blog post (probably because I'm standing behind you nodding my head and asking you what you think). 

Postmodernists be damned, most of us also recognise that some truths about the world still exist. So if the world is inconsistent, if we all disagree all the time, how do we know what's true?

At some point, (even before the invention of classical logic) somebody made the miraculous discovery that we all have reasons for the beliefs we hold. And we really like to make others agree with us by yelling our reasons at them and covering our ears until they give in to the barrage of noise and say "sure, whatever".

Now, this system is great, especially when its me doing the talking. Sometimes, unfortunately, we have to concede and hear people out.

In this case, how do we know who and what to believe? who's giving better reasons? why should I be convinced that Eppstein didn't kill himself?

This is what argumentation theorists get paid to argue about. One of the main ways of doing this is by studying the common patterns of argument that we come across when we look at data and identifying the ways in which these arguments could be called into question. This kind of critical questioning has two challenges, in the first case we need to know which set of critical questions apply to the argument at hand and also, which question(s) is(are) the most relevant to challenge what has been said.
