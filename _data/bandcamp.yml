  liner: “all that broke from a single lamp” is my debut ambient album. Its rich sonic landscape undertakes an exploration of unravelling structures, and the remnants of lost edifices swim to a murky surface. Through braiding together harsh, at times painful, textures with fragile shimmerings, it tries its hand at reweaving an inner world cascading out of its seams. Amongst collapsing soundscapes and disintegrating patterns, moments of stillness emerge in an attempt to find refuge amongst fervent torrents. Inspired by mystic ideology, the album represents the culmination of many hours of meditation and reflection into my relationship with my own self. <br> <br> “Know that this existence is neither you nor other than you. You do not exist; yet you are also not a nonexistence.” <br> ~ Ibn 'Arabi
